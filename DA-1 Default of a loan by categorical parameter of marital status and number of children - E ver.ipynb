    "There for we could get to the conclusion tha the merital status and/or having children, have an effect on default a loan, at least no a profaund efect that shows in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when looking at other possible reasons, one criteria has stood up showing that there are categories from it that are shown in a very concentrated way in the group of customers who have debt. This criteria was the 'purpose' category of 'car' loan application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also , It seems that when the total income of a customer is less then 30,000 anualy and he is applying for loan, has more chance to default.\n",

    "\n",
    "we did not find any connectio between tha merital status and having children , direct effect on a loan default. Instead, we sugest that the criteria to be taken is the one of purpose of a loan that is intended to be use for a car , and to look at the total income of a customer that earns less then 30,000 anualy."
